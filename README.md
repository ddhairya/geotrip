# React App [GeoTrip](https://ddhairya.github.io/geotrip/) to get an egale view of the destinations you wish to visit


## Available Use of Libraies and Technologies :
1.  Leaflet
2.  Bootstrap
3.  Styled-components
4.  Map

Couple of time have faced issue whenever planning for a trip. Which are the location need to cover on Day -n. Have though why not to make simple app which will accept the name and  latitude and longitude of the desitination and put it in the map.
Regardless of order of the enteries just seeing will get an egale view which are all the destination easly being able to cover in a day.

Due to free service it might not look as presentable as Google Services but worth giving a try.
